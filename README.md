# Recommendation_System

<p>In this project, I have developed two exciting variants of a recommendation system for books using a rich dataset. This is a personalized recommendation system which leveraages user data and recommends them books accordingly. If the user is a new user then it will recommend them top 100 rated books.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Are you tired of scrolling through endless book lists, unsure of what to read next? Our Book Recommendation System is here to help! This project leverages the power of data to provide you with personalized book recommendations based on your preferences and reading history.</p>

<h2>Variants</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Memory-Based Recommendation:</strong> This variant relies on user-item interactions to make recommendations. It uses collaborative filtering techniques to find books that similar users have enjoyed.</li>
  <li><strong>Model-Based Recommendation:</strong> In this variant, I've implemented a sophisticated recommendation model. It goes beyond user-item interactions and uses matrix factorisation  to predict your book preferences. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started with the Book Recommendation System, follow these simple steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clone this repository to your local machine using <code>git clone</code>.</li>
  <li>Install the required dependencies listed in the <code>requirements.txt</code> file using <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.</li>
  <li>Explore the code for both memory-based and model-based recommendation systems in their respective folders.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The recommendation system is built using a comprehensive dataset containing book details, user ratings, and more. You can find the dataset we used here: <a href="insert_dataset_link_here">Link to Dataset</a>.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>I would like to express my gratitude to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset">insert_dataset_source</a> for providing the dataset used in this project. This project would not have been possible without their valuable contribution.</p>
